This project has two part view : Light and Dark.
LightHomePage , LightDetail , _CountrySection are view pages for _LightLayout .
DarkHomePage , DarkDetail , _CountrySectionDark are view pages for _DarkLayout .
To Switch to Dark or Light mode you can use the link on the right top of the pages.
Data of countries get from service in project .
some detail css for example shadows are not completely like design but I try to make it more close to design pages.
